    INJURY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. IN NO EVENT SHALL ACTIVESTATE'S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES FOR

    delivery arising out of causes beyond their reasonable control and without their fault or negligence,
    including, but not limited to, Acts of God, acts of civil or military authority, fires, riots, wars,
    embargoes, Internet disruptions, hacker attacks, or communications failures. Notwithstanding anything to the
    contrary contained herein, if either party is unable to perform hereunder for a period of thirty (30)

    promotional material. Requests cannot be complied with retroactively and may require up to thirty days to

    respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and merges all prior communications, representations, and
    agreements. ACTIVESTATE reserves the right to change this Agreement at any time, which change shall be
    effective immediately upon its posting into any future release of the Software. If any provision of this
    Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the Province of
    British Columbia, Canada, excluding rules regarding conflicts of law. The application of the United Nations
    Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. The parties agree that
    the Uniform Computer Transactions Act or any version thereof, adopted by any state, in any form ("UCITA"),
    shall not apply to this Agreement, and to the extent that UCITA may be applicable, the parties agree to opt
    out of the applicability of UCITA pursuant to the opt-out provision(s) contained therein.
